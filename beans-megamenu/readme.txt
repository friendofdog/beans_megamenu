== Description ==

Mega menu plugin for Beans themes (http://www.getbeans.io/). Comprised of two sections:
(1) A top section to highlight main offerings. Takes a uk-icon-{} or font awesome icon. On hover over an item in this section, text is displayed to the right.
(2) A below section to list any other items needed in the menu. No icons or hover effects, just links.

== Installation ==

Install this plugin as you would any other. Requires Beans Theme or a child of this theme.

You need to make four menus, which correspond with menu locations generated by this plugin (Appearance -> Menus -> Manage Locations):
Primary Menu        menu items will go to right of MegaMenu trigger
Mobile              mobile menu (as MegaMenu is not practical for mobile)
MegaMenu CTA        menu items will go at top of MegaMenu; put uk-icon-{} class in Title Attribute and hover text in Description
MegaMenu Main       for any other items you want to list; does not take an icon (you can still add one inline)

Please note...
- This plugin assumes that you're compiling assets using the Beans compiler
- Menu item dropdown mode is 'click' as hover is not practical for MegaMenu
- UIKit components STICKY and TOGGLE are enqueued site-wide
- The page will still scroll under the MegaMenu (page content can be made visible by decreasing MegaMenu opacity)
